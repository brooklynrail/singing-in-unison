In 2022, Rail Curatorial Projects presented seven exhibitions that brought to life the art of joining by showcasing the work of artists young and old, taught and self taught, emerging and established side-by-side. The series, titled “Singing in Unison”, has thus far been presented at Art Cake, the Scully Tomasko Foundation, TOTAH, Below Grand, Ricco/Maresca, Miguel Abreu, and Industry City.

_Democracy in America_, Alexis de Tocqueville’s 1835 revolutionary tome, introduced the “art of joining”—a theory that proposes that mere gatherings of individuals spanning “all ages, all conditions, and all minds” act as a powerful foil to the potential hazards of government.
