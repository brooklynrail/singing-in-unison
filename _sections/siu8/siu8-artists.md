[Jesse Chun](https://www.jessechun.com/) (b. Seoul, South Korea ) is an artist working between New York and Seoul. Chun’s immersive poetics in moving image, drawing, sculpture, and installation address language. Traversing found historiographies, translations, and imprints of linguistic imperialism as a site for rupture, abstraction, and (un)languaging, Chun unearths alternate semiotics and cosmologies for non-linear passages of meaning, time, and the untranslatable.

[Futoshi Miyagi](https://fmiyagi.com/) (b. Okinawa, Japan) works in various mediums, such as photography, objects, video and text, to construct narratives on the subjects of sexual minorities and untold stories in history, often in relation to Okinawa.

[Maya Jeffereis](https://mayajeffereis.com/Front-page) (b. Los Angeles; Based in New York) is an artist working in video, performance, and installation.

Known for her visually striking, multilayered, performative, and poetic feminist works, she brings past and present into relation to negotiate and mediate means of representation, resistance, and recognition.

[Yuki Kihara](https://yukikihara.ws/) (b. Apia, Sāmoa) is an interdisciplinary artist of Japanese and Sāmoan descent.

With an interdisciplinary approach, her installations often span several media, including sculpture, photography, video, sound, text, and performance. By employing her body and mind as an experiential interface, Lins looks into the subjects of cultural identities, struggles, correlated relationships between our physicality and psychology, and the resemblance between art making and manufacturing in social content.

[Yu Liu](https://liu-yu.net/) (b. Taiwan) employs a variety of mediums such as video, installation, and texts, to develop a series of documentary field studies about how humans envision the world, how attributes of spaces change, and how things are constantly being defined in a system–all contributing to an account on the progression of humanity.

[Vandy Rattana](https://vandyrattana.com/) (b. Phnom Penh, Cambodia) has focused on challenging conditions in his home country by documenting natural and manmade disasters.

West Java, Indonesia) are an artist duo whose tactical, interventionist approach is developed in response to living in a megacity of 15 million people, and amid large-scale contemporary political power struggles. They frequently deal with social issues in public space, translating them into spontaneously unfolding events.

[Lieko Shiga](https://www.liekoshiga.com/) (b. Aichi, Japan) is a photographer whose practice connects inquiries about the nature of the photographic medium with fundamental questions about life and the means of expressing oneself. Characterized by their intense color saturation, heavy use of flash, and uncanny, dreamlike tone, Shiga’s photographs deliberately transgress the conventions of documentary photography, blurring the boundaries between reality and representation, and drawing on local myths and personal accounts.

[Kahurangiariki Smith](https://kahurangiarikismith.wixsite.com/website) (b. Kirikiriroa, Aotearoa) was raised with traditional Maori values, she has a keen interest in her heritage and the stories of her ancestors.

[Su Yu Hsin](https://www.suyuhsin.net/) (b. Taichung, Taiwan, lives in Berlin) is an artist who approaches ecology from the point of view of its close relationship with technology.

[Pangrok Sulap](https://pangroksulap.com/) (based in Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia) is an Indigenous artist collective composed of members from the Dusun and Murut clans of Malaysian Borneo. The collective uses print-making techniques in a collaborative effort with their local communities, spreading the power of large-scale prints as a means of activating social agency in a part of Malaysia that is of little familiarity with contemporary art. Committed to the need for education, the collective also raises awareness of locally-relevant social and political issues such as illegal logging, corruption, and the mining of historical memories.

[Hong-Kai Wang](https://www.w-h-k.net/) (b. Huiwei, Taiwan) is an artist who works across exhibition making, performance, publication, and teaching. Wang’s research-based practice confronts the politics of knowledge lost in colonial and diasporic encounters at the intersection of lived experience, power, and “listening.”
