[Yu Liu](https://liu-yu.net/) (b.

[Pangrok Sulap](https://pangroksulap.com/) (based in Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia) is an Indigenous artist collective composed of members from the Dusun and Murut clans of Malaysian Borneo. The collective uses print-making techniques in a collaborative effort with their local communities, spreading the power of large-scale prints as a means of activating social agency in a part of Malaysia that is of little familiarity with contemporary art. Committed to the need for education, the collective also raises awareness of locally-relevant social and political issues such as illegal logging, corruption, and the mining of historical memories.

[Vandy Rattana](https://vandyrattana.com/) (b. Phnom Penh, Cambodia) has focused on challenging conditions in his home country by documenting natural and manmade disasters.

West Java, Indonesia) are an artist duo whose tactical, interventionist approach is developed in response to living in a megacity of 15 million people, and amid large-scale contemporary political power struggles.

[Lieko Shiga](https://www.liekoshiga.com/) (b. Aichi, Japan) is a photographer whose practice connects inquiries about the nature of the photographic medium with fundamental questions about life and the means of expressing oneself. Characterized by their intense color saturation, heavy use of flash, and uncanny, dreamlike tone, Shiga’s photographs deliberately transgress the conventions of documentary photography, blurring the boundaries between reality and representation, and drawing on local myths and personal accounts.

Kirikiriroa, Aotearoa) was raised with traditional Maori values, she has a keen interest in her heritage and the stories of her ancestors.

[Hong-Kai Wang](https://www.w-h-k.net/) (b. Huiwei, Taiwan) is an artist who works across exhibition making, performance, publication, and teaching.
