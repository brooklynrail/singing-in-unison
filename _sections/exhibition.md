<div class="margin-bottom-3 lead font-sans-lg tablet:font-sans-xl measure-4 text-light">The exhibition ‘Between Waves’ encompasses contemporary images, stories, histories, and oceanic myths of the Asia-Pacific region through the interconnectedness of islands and oceans linked by transformative technology.

This vast living body of water contains a vibrant, strong cultural presence perpetually resilient in light of colonialism, world war, Cold War, nuclear threat, and ecological disasters.

In his work titled "Our Sea of Islands" published in 1993, Fijian anthropologist Epeli Hau’ofa mentioned the concept, “islands in a far sea”,  focusing on the smallness, isolation, and seclusion of islands; while "Ocean of Islands”  views the wholeness of their relationship from a comprehensive interdependent perspective.

This exhibition takes these statements as inspiration to illuminate island histories, culture, beliefs, and bio-politics to shed light on the many islands' potential futures revealed by works from 17 contemporary artists, photographers, filmmakers, with numerous writers, musicians and thinkers and poets.
The artworks trace currents between individual islands and groups of islanders carrying memory, historical trauma, reflection on co-existence, and new possibilities.

Echoes of recovery and trauma still resonate with the process of ever-changing militarization across the islands. Here, waves are fluidic metaphors, a means of navigation for lives in-between stable points and currents. Islands become constellations of memories suspended in contrast with continents, reality and dreams, tradition and modernity, past and present. 25,000 islands, islets and atolls are strewn across the Pacific Ocean, with over 1000 languages spoken among them. Historically these islands' cultures are influenced by the natural current, which shaped their own unique belief system and rituals. The ocean currents bridge those islands and the culture that connects and empowers them to become agents of change. In Oceania, life is in constant flux and migration between multiple worlds. Embracing this complicated departure point, "Between the Waves" exhibition brings together a cross section of these many cultures. The artists invite us to drift among perspectives concerning geopolitical tensions, reinterpreting their histories, conflicting societal values, and the nature of trauma and agency within the waves of the ocean.
 
The artists in this exhibition will come from this specific geographical composition and present a new cultural reinterpretation of the "island chain”, the Cold War designation of the east-west frontier beginning with Taiwan as the center point, and stretching from Japan, Okinawa, and the Philippines, Borneo, Jeju Island with further extension across the Pacific through Hawaii islands, American Samoa and New Zealand.
