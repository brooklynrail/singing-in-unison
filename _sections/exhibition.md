Curated by Alice, Nien-Pu Ko, Singing in Unison, Part 8: Between Waves will carry on the ethos of previous installments, but through a lens that centers the Asia-Pacific. Drawing on histories, contemporary iconography, stories, and oceanic myths, the exhibition will use transformative technologies to bridge the islands that comprise the region. Referred to as the “Ocean of Islands,” some 25,000 islands, islets, and atolls are scattered amidst the Pacific Ocean, between them there are nearly 1,000 languages spoken. 

Despite the breadth of the region, there is a shared political trauma resulting from colonialism, militarism, warfare (global, nuclear), and ecological disaster; however, as Fijian anthropologist Epeli Hau’ofa suggests in his 1993 book Our Sea of Islands, there’s also a smallness and isolation inherent to islands. 

The exhibition aims to specifically explore this dichotomy with the work of seventeen artists, filmmakers, photographers, poets, musicians, and thinkers, each who make use of their nation’s culture, history, beliefs, and biopolitics to shape a narrative of what was, what is, and what can be. 

Like the waves that surround them, many of the regions throughout Oceania remain in constant flux: an ever-changing militarization throughout the islands, ongoing efforts at recovery, the coexistence of traditional and modern thinking, geopolitical tensions, conflicting social values. Embracing the complicated nature of the region, Between Waves offers a cross-section of the many cultures (and their belief systems, rituals, etc.) with contributors hailing from Taiwan, Japan, the Philippines, Borneo, Jeju Island, the Hawaiian islands, American Samoa, and New Zealand. 

The eighth iteration will once again occupy the 16,000 square foot space in Industry City. Recently remodeled by the Brooklyn Rail and Rail Curatorial Projects on the occasion of Singing in Unison, Part 7, the gallery was once a United States Post Office sorting facility.
