**Peter Acheson** received his BFA from Yale in 1976. An early member of the Williamsburg art scene of the 1980s, Acheson relocated to upstate New York where he has worked since the 90s. Acheson utilizes an array of found materials discovered around his upstate studio—including animal bones and petrified wood—alongside acrylic and oil on canvas and wooden panels.

**Gret Sterrett Smith** studied painting at Goddard College with James Gahagan, and graduated with a BFA in painting in 1980 from the San Francisco Art Institute, where she studied with Hassel Smith, Franklin Williams, Robert Hudson, and Angela Davis, and was part of the group of artists and poets in Jess and Robert Duncan’s household and Diane di Prima’s circle. She moved to New York in 1993 and has been painting, drawing, and making sculptures ever since.
