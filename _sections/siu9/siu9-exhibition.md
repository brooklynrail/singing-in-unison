_Singing in Unison, Part 9_, in collaboration with SLAG&RX, is presenting a selection of paintings by Peter Acheson in dialogue with sculptures by Gret Sterrett Smith.

Both artists are products of countercultural movements that reject American jingoism and consumerism, and have shared a lifelong interest in the Jungian theory of the collective unconscious, considering alchemy’s dual nature—the chemical and mystical—which has shaped their lives. Though they each have deeply contemplated in different ways the visionary lineage that can be traced back to the works of Carl Jung, Albert Pinkham Ryder, Robert Duncan, Jess, Diane di Prima, James Hillman, Michael Heizer, Gillian Jagger, Martin Puryear to Ron Gorchov, Ursula von Rydingsvard, and Bill Jensen, both Acheson and Smith yield a similar affinity in respect to their pictorial processes.

While Acheson came to artistic maturity while working in New York City, Smith’s roots are in San Francisco. Though they share a mutual disregard for the traditional boundaries of artmaking, and a similar comparable preference for fluid migration and the inseparability of forms and materials, they do so in different ways. Acheson insists on an iterative practice that constantly lays the groundwork for the transmutation of legible images, abstract emblems, inscriptions, and asemic writings, among other unnamable mark-makings in his configurations. Smith, on the other hand, effortlessly creates provisional constructions, bringing disparate elements together three-dimensionally only to accentuate their precarious forms in relation to gravity and visual paradoxes.

Despite Acheson’s two-dimensional pictorial conception of his work, the aura of his deployment of materials often achieves three-dimensional substance. Likewise, Smith thinks through form in her sculptures using the two-dimensional framework of collage. This visual dialogue between Acheson and Smith therefore posits their mediations of alchemical processes as a revelation of the wondrous affinities between the transcendent nature of their psyches, and their visceral and individual approaches to artmaking.<br/><br/>
